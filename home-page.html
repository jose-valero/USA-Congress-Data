        <p>
          <span>&nbsp &nbsp</span>Openness, accountability, and honesty define
          government transparency. In a free society, transparency is
          government's obligation to share information with citizens. It is at
          the heart of how citizens hold their public officials accountable.
          Here at TGIF we believe that government should be transparent.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>&nbsp &nbsp</span>Governments exist to serve the people.
          Information on how officials conduct the public business and spend
          taxpayer money must be readily available and easily understood. This
          transparency allows good and just governance. Transparency promotes
          accountability and provides information for citizens about what their
          Government is doing.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>&nbsp &nbsp</span>We also believe that government should be
          participatory. Public engagement enhances the Government's
          effectiveness and improves the quality of its decisions. Knowledge is
          widely dispersed in society, and public officials benefit from having
          access to that dispersed knowledge. We invite you to use our site to
          become actively engaged in American government.

            <h3>Background History of Government Transparency</h3>
            <p>
              <span>&nbsp &nbsp</span>In the West, the idea that government
              should be open to public scrutiny and susceptible to public
              opinion dates back at least to the time of the Enlightenment, when
              many philosophes made an attack on absolutist doctrine of state
              secrecy, a core part of their intellectual project. The passage of
              formal legislative instruments to this end can also be traced to
              this time with Sweden, for example, (which then included Finland
              as a Swedish-governed territory) enacting free press legislation
              as part of its constitution (Freedom of the Press Act, 1766). This
              approach, and that of the philosophes more broadly, is strongly
              related to recent historiography on the eighteenth-century public
              sphere.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>&nbsp &nbsp</span>Influenced by Enlightenment thought, the
              revolutions in America (1776) and France (1789), freedom of the
              press enshrined provisions and requirements for public budgetary
              accounting and freedom of the press in constitutional articles. In
              the nineteenth century, attempts by Metternichean statesmen to row
              back on these measures were vigorously opposed by a number of
              eminent liberal politicians and writers, Bentham, Mill and Acton
              prominent among the latter.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>&nbsp &nbsp</span>Open government is widely seen to be a key
              hallmark of contemporary democratic practice and is often linked
              to the passing of freedom of information legislation. Scandinavian
              countries claim to have adopted the first freedom of information
              legislation, dating the origins of its modern provisions to the
              eighteenth century and Finland continuing the presumption of
              openness after gaining independence in 1917, passing its Act on
              Publicity of Official Documents in 1951 (superseded by new
              legislation in 1999).
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>&nbsp &nbsp</span>The United States passed its Freedom of
              Information Act (FOIA) in 1966, FOIAs, Access to Information Acts
              (AIAs) or equivalent laws were passed in Denmark and Norway in
              1970.
